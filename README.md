# Air Quality Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the air quality based on pollutant concentrations using machine learning. Instead of calculating the AQI through a formula, we directly predict the AQI category based on the concentration of various pollutants.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and includes air quality data from multiple cities across India between 2015 and 2020.  
You can access the dataset here: [Air Quality Data in India (2015-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
## Rendering Issue
Sometimes, the Jupyter notebook might not render properly on GitHub. If you run into this issue, you can download the notebook or view it using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
## AQI Categories
Weâ€™ve used the following AQI categories for this project:
- **Good**: <=50.0
- **Satisfactory**: 51.0 - 100.0
- **Moderate**: 101.0 - 200.0
- **Poor**: 201.0 - 300.0
- **Very Poor**: 301.0 - 400.0
- **Severe**: 401.0>

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- I plotted time-series for both vehicular and industrial pollution across cities, both before and after COVID-19.
- The analysis showed that cities like Delhi and Gurugram had the highest pollution levels, while Shillong had the least.
- I also analyzed the AQI trends in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan cities.


### Model Selection
After evaluating the different models, I selected the **Random Forest Classifier** as the final model due to its better generalization and reduced overfitting compared to the SVM and Decision Tree models.
The accuracy obtained is 100%.
